EWCacheManager
=============

EWCacheManager is a singleton class for convenient cache management, using [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) for HTTP request management. I ([@yurrriq](https://github.com/yurrriq)) mostly created this for my own use, and to get famililar with the process of [writing documentation for Objective-C classes](http://nshipster.com/documentation/).
